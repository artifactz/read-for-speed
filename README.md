# Read for Speed

Enhances readability by bolding the first half of every word in a PDF file.

## Overview

This web service processes PDF files to improve readability, particularly for people with ADHD, by emphasizing the beginnings of words.
These serve as visual markers that can help your brain predict word endings, plan more efficient eye movements, and stay focused.
